## Planning

**TODO:**

* [ ] Decide if we want to keep this section in a book?
* [ ] If no, remove entire section
* [ ] If yes, what to cover?

This is phase that most people find boring. Its only after working on long running projects over years, you will realize your productivty would not have degraded over the time, had you better plan your project at the beginning.

So unless you wish to regret later, read this section before going ahead.
