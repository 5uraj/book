## What is wp-cli

A command line interface for WordPress

WP-CLI is a set of command-line tools for managing WordPress installations. You can update plugins, set up multisite installs and much more, without using a web browser.
## Let's Install wp-cli

Download wp-cli.phar using curl or wget
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```
or
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```
Check if it works using following command
```
php wp-cli.phar --info
```
Now, we don't want to use `php wp-cli.phar` as command so let's put it somewhere in path so we can use it as `wp`.
```bash
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```
try running `wp --info`

For all command list run `wp help` you can also run help for subcommand `wp help plugin`

Refer: [wp-cli homepage](http://wp-cli.org/) if any error occurs during installation.
