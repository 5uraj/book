### Checklist to test the demo sites after migration

We migrated our demo sites with EE4. Below are check list which we cross checked before we deploy the sites.

1. Import the data from the old site so that we have some data to check if everything looks good.
2. Activate the required plugins, add-ons, themes as needed.
3. Install **Query Monitor **plugin if it is not there and activate it so that you won’t miss any Errors, Warnings or Notices thrown. Still keep an eye on console errors too.
4. For rtMedia Add-ons, add their respective License keys.
5. Configure the new site set up same as old sites. And do some data entry.
6. Check each and every since functionality if is working as expected.
7. Check for the errors, notices and warnings.
8. Log the outcome of each single thing which is not working as expected with proper tags and/or labels so that it can be delegated properly.
9. Do cross browser testing as well.
10. After self testing, get your site cross checked with peer team member if possible.
