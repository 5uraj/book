# Testing & Git Intergation

Whenever there is a new feature and/or fix is added to rtMedia or any premium add-on/themes, the QA team member is asked to test those changes. To speed up the testing, it is better to set up the local test environment on your system. Follow the below steps to get the latest code on your system.

1. Clone the repo. **git clone &lt;URL&gt;**
2. Checkout the branch \(from which the code is to be tested\). **git checkout -b &lt;Branch\_Name&gt;**
3. Pull the code from the branch. **git pull &lt;remote&gt; &lt;Branch\_Name&gt;**
4. Test the code and report the issues.

Note: Please refer [this](/content/git/index.md) for more git commands and its usage as per your requirement.
