## Two main categories:
1. cross-browser (css/js front-end perfection)
2. single-browser (raw functioanlity tests)


## Tools

1. Selenium
2. Node.js based

### Compare

| Selenium | node.js |
| -- | -- |
| Tests are written in JAVA | Tests are written in nodejs |
| Complicated to setup | Much easier to setup |
| Tools are finalized | Exacts tools are yet to finalize |

### Node.js based options

**List of tools**

1. [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) - just a browser
2. [theintern.io](http://theintern.io/#compare) - has too many features and still not much talked about. Need to check why?
3. [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) - from Angular JS team. They have one more
4. [nightwatchjs](http://nightwatchjs.org/) - another famius tool

**Evaluation criteria**
1. Do we need unit tetsing in nodejs?
2. Do we need cross-browser testing in nodejs?
3. Cookie/session support
4. File upload support
5. AJAX support
